# FrameSelector
simple GUI for showing a video, with shortcut(c) to save current frame, you can move simple frame by frame, or second by second. It's a good tool if you want to move across the whole video to caputre specific frames

It was made specifically for lawynly project(to colorize anime images), to create the dataset, however it's updated no to select the frames by DL models; to chooose frames only that have meaningful information in another repo.
